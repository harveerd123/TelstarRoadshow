        <strong>Telstar Roadshow</strong> was born in the early 1980s, founded by the original 
        <span class="font-semibold text-white">Ammo</span>, one of the first DJs and MCs to pioneer the Asian 
        entertainment scene. At a time when live bands dominated, Telstar saw the gap — and filled it. 
        As one of the very first to introduce professional DJs to the market, we can proudly say we were 
        responsible for the birth of the Asian DJ industry.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-200">
        Many of today’s biggest names in the industry grew from the trail we blazed. Always ahead of the curve, 
        Telstar was among the first to move from vinyl to CDs, and later to PCs and cutting-edge technology — 
        constantly setting the standard others tried to match.

        The Legacy Continues
      </h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-200">
        Today, Telstar continues as a proud family-run business, passed down from Ammo to his nephew 
        <span class="font-semibold text-white">Kirat</span>. Kirat’s passion for music began at just 13 years old, 
        and over the years he has been part of many major roadshows, learning from some of the biggest names 
        in the industry. With this experience, Kirat decided to carry on the legacy of Telstar and bring it back 
        stronger than ever.

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-200">
        He has since carved his own reputation on the scene — performing at events across the UK, working with 
        artists such as <span class="font-semibold text-white">The Dark MC</span>, and even featuring in music videos.
