                    “I booked Dj Kirat for my sisters 18th birthday and he did not disappoint! He’s very friendly and easy going, with incredible DJing skills, his music catered for all my guests and definitely made the night very memorable as he got the crowd going. He was prepared, well equipped and punctual and the process for booking was very quick and simple. I would highly recommend for any event as he can adapt and tailor to your needs.”

Perfectly tuned in to our students, DJ Kirat made the ‘culture day’ at our secondary school - the kids loved the music and the vibe was like a party/rave/club but all perfectly suited for our school setting! Looking forward to our next culture day with DJ Kirat! Thank you so much!”
